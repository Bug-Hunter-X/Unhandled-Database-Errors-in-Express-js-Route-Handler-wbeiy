# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors during database interactions within route handlers.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data.  If the database query fails (e.g., due to a connection error or incorrect query), the application will likely crash or return an incomplete response.  The solution shows how to gracefully handle these errors, preventing unexpected behavior and providing informative responses to clients.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (`npm install express pg` assuming a PostgreSQL database)
3. Configure the database connection (update the code in bug.js and bugSolution.js accordingly). 
4. Run `node bug.js` and simulate a database failure (e.g., by disconnecting the database or entering an invalid query). Observe the application's behavior.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` and repeat the database failure simulation. Note the improved error handling and response.
